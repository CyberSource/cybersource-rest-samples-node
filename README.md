# Node.js Sample Code for the CyberSource SDK

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Node.js integration with the CyberSource REST APIs through the CyberSource Node.JS SDK.

***NOTE: THIS REPO OF CODE SAMPLES HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC FOR SDK TESTING AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION - YET.  PLEASE RAISE AN ISSUE ON THIS REPO IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS AND CHECK BACK SOON FOR GENERAL AVAILABILITY ***

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained. You can analyze them to get an understanding of how a particular method works, or you can use the snippets as a starting point for your own project.

You can also run each sample directly from the command line.

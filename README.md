# Node.js Sample Code for the CyberSource SDK

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Node.js integration with the cybersourceRest-rest-client-nodejs and cybersource-rest-auth-nodejs

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained. You can analyze them to get an understanding of how a particular method works, or you can use the snippets as a starting point for your own project.

You can also run each sample directly from the command line.

## Running the Samples From the Command Line
* Clone this repository:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node
```
* Install the cybersource-rest-client-nodejs
```
    $ npm install 
```
* Run the individual samples by name. For example: 
```
    $ node [DirectoryPath]\[CodeSampleName]
```
e.g.
